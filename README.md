Baguette Tennis
===============

CLONE of the classic arcade and early home console game PONG.

Major Jamie Dodger-McCrumbs has a heart of jam, but a ferocious temper which makes for some sticky situations! 

You must score 5 points against him to earn your precious clue.

Use the UP and DOWN cursor keys to move your baguette and deflect the Jammie Dodger back to your opponent.
